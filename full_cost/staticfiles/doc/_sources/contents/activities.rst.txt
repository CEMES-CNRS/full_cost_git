==========

This link will get you to the dedicated web page. We classified the lab activities as follow:

* :ref:`ref_act_chemistry`: for all experiments of the Chemistry Service
* :ref:`ref_act_opt_serv`: for all experiments of the Optical Service
* :ref:`ref_act_imag`: for all AFM and near-field machines (AFM/STM...) (but the TERS)
* :ref:`ref_act_engi`: Mechanics and electronics are grouped within this activity
* :ref:`ref_act_tem`: for all electronic microscopes
* :ref:`ref_act_fib`: for the Helios and Zeiss FIB
* :ref:`ref_act_ps2i`: for all experiments of the PS2I service
* :ref:`ref_act_prepa`: for all apparatus/tools of the preparation service but the FIBs
* :ref:`ref_act_nanofab`: for all apparatus related to fabrication: Growth, implantation, clean room tools and apparatus.

For all of these, you can do three things:

* Add New *Working Units* (default activity web page)
* See a *Working Units* exhaustive summary
* *Export* this summary as an excel file
